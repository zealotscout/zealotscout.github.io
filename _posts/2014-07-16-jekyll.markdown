description: Jekyll has been a part of hobby site project to me, but whos not to say that it has some great potential, I found Jekyll to be a increibly nice experience for rapidly creating web content, while quickly pushing to github repositories for everyone to see. I'm currently working around to getting to know more of jekyll.
