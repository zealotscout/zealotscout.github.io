description: Since the very first day I picked up laravel on behalf of my current employer, I knew laravel was going to be my calling, from the presentation of neatly bundled documentation, to the ease of access of simply readying a virtual machine called homestead, and in a matter of 15~30 minutes a completely ready environment is set for coding, including database and webserver.
